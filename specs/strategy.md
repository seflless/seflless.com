# Content Strategy & Distribution Protocol

## The Big Picture

### What Story Am I Telling?

**Core Narrative (1 sentence)**:
_[TODO: Define your one-sentence narrative. Example: "I build tools that make complex things feel simple, and I share what I learn along the way."]_

**Extended Narrative (3-5 sentences)**:
_[TODO: What's your journey? What problems do you care about? What unique perspective do you bring?]_

**Why Should Anyone Care?**
- What value do you provide that others don't?
- What experiences shape your perspective?
- What are you building toward?

### Voice & Personality

**Tone**:
- [ ] Technical but accessible
- [ ] Personal but not self-indulgent
- [ ] Opinionated but open to being wrong
- [ ] Curious, not preachy

**Writing Principles**:
1. **Useful > Impressive** - Every post should leave the reader with something actionable
2. **Show the work** - Include the messy middle, not just polished results
3. **Connect the dots** - Relate technical content to bigger themes
4. **Your story serves their problem** - Personal anecdotes only when they illuminate the point

**Voice Check Questions**:
- Would I say this to a friend over coffee?
- Is there a "so what" for the reader?
- Am I explaining or showing off?
- Does my experience add context or just credibility-signaling?

## Content Pillars

Define 3-5 themes that all your content connects to. These create coherence across posts.

### Pillar 1: [Name]
_[Example: "Making complex tools accessible"]_
- What it means:
- Why you care:
- Example topics:

### Pillar 2: [Name]
_[Example: "The craft of building software"]_
- What it means:
- Why you care:
- Example topics:

### Pillar 3: [Name]
_[Example: "Creative coding & visual experiments"]_
- What it means:
- Why you care:
- Example topics:

### Pillar 4: [Name]
_[Example: "Building in public"]_
- What it means:
- Why you care:
- Example topics:

## Evergreen Content Strategy

### What Makes Content Evergreen?

1. **Solves a recurring problem** - People search for it repeatedly
2. **Introduces a concept** - Becomes reference material
3. **Has a memorable hook** - Title or framing that sticks
4. **Stays technically accurate** - Or is easy to update

### Evergreen Post Types

**Reference Posts** (highest value, hardest to write)
- Definitive guide to X
- "Everything you need to know about Y"
- Comparison/decision frameworks
- Cheatsheets and quick references

**Concept Introductions**
- Name a pattern you've observed
- Create vocabulary for something unnamed
- "The [Catchy Name] Problem" format

**Tutorials with Longevity**
- Focus on principles over specific versions
- Include "why" not just "how"
- Update notes at top when things change

### Title Formulas That Work

- "The [Concept] Pattern: [Benefit]"
- "[Number] [Things] I Learned [Doing X]"
- "Why [Counterintuitive Thing] Actually Works"
- "[Common Approach] Is Wrong, Here's Why"
- "The Definitive Guide to [Topic]"
- "[Analogy]: A Mental Model for [Technical Thing]"

## Distribution Strategy

### Primary Channels

| Channel | Best For | Frequency | Notes |
|---------|----------|-----------|-------|
| Blog | Long-form, reference content | 1-2x/month | Home base, SEO |
| Twitter/X | Threads, quick insights | Daily-ish | Audience building |
| LinkedIn | Professional content | 1x/week | Different audience |
| Hacker News | Technical deep dives | When exceptional | High risk/reward |
| Reddit | Niche communities | Contextual | r/programming, etc. |
| Dev.to/Hashnode | Crosspost | With originals | Wider reach |

### Distribution Checklist

When publishing a post:

**Immediate (Day 0)**
- [ ] Tweet thread summarizing key points
- [ ] LinkedIn post (reframe for that audience)
- [ ] Share in relevant Discord/Slack communities
- [ ] Email to people who'd find it useful (personal, not blast)

**Short-term (Day 1-7)**

- [ ] Post to relevant subreddits
- [ ] Crosspost to Dev.to/Hashnode
- [ ] Share in niche newsletters' tip lines

**Long-term**

- [ ] Re-share on anniversaries or when newly relevant

### Who to Contact for Distribution

**Build relationships with:**
- Newsletter curators in your space
- Podcast hosts (for interview-worthy content)
- Conference organizers (for talk proposals)
- Developer advocates at relevant companies
- Other bloggers for cross-promotion

**Contact List Template:**
| Name | Platform | Topics They Cover | How to Reach | Notes |
|------|----------|-------------------|--------------|-------|
| | | | | |

## Multi-Format Content

### From One Post, Create Many Assets

**Blog Post** (canonical, long-form)
↓
**Twitter Thread** (condensed highlights)
↓
**Video Walkthrough** (screen recording, 5-15 min)
↓
**Short Demo GIF** (for social sharing)
↓
**Code Snippet** (for GitHub gists)
↓
**Talk Proposal** (if meaty enough)

### Asset Readiness Levels

| Level | State | Use Case |
|-------|-------|----------|
| **Draft** | Rough, unpolished | Internal review only |
| **Beta** | Working but rough edges | Trusted friends, early feedback |
| **Ready** | Polished, reviewed | Public distribution |
| **Evergreen** | Maintained, up-to-date | Long-term reference |

### Video/Demo Standards

**Screen recordings:**
- 1080p minimum, 4K preferred
- Clean desktop (hide personal stuff)
- Zoom on important UI elements
- Voiceover or captions
- Keep under 10 minutes unless tutorial

**Demo GIFs:**
- Under 10MB for Twitter
- Highlight the "wow" moment
- Loop cleanly
- Include caption/context

## The Campaign Model

### What's a Content Campaign?

A **campaign** is a coordinated series of related content around a theme. Instead of random posts, you build toward something.

**Campaign Structure:**
1. **Seed post** - Introduce the theme/problem
2. **Deep dives** - Explore specific aspects
3. **Showcase** - Demonstrate with a project
4. **Synthesis** - Tie it together, lessons learned

**Example Campaign: "Building in Public"**
1. "Why I'm Building My Blog in Public" (seed)
2. "How I Chose Astro Over Next.js" (deep dive)
3. "Implementing the Perfect Dark Mode Toggle" (deep dive)
4. "The Full Stack of My Personal Site" (showcase)
5. "What I Learned After 10 Posts" (synthesis)

### Campaign Planning Template

**Campaign Name:** _____________
**Theme/Pillar:** _____________
**Goal:** _____________
**Timeline:** _____________

| # | Post Title | Type | Status | Dependencies |
|---|------------|------|--------|--------------|
| 1 | | Seed | | |
| 2 | | Deep dive | | |
| 3 | | Deep dive | | |
| 4 | | Showcase | | |
| 5 | | Synthesis | | |

## Process Improvement Protocol

### After Every Post

**Quick Retro (5 min):**
- What worked well?
- What was harder than expected?
- What would I do differently?
- Did it hit the target audience?

### Monthly Review

- Which posts performed best? Why?
- Which took too long? Why?
- Am I staying true to my pillars?
- Is my voice consistent?
- What topics are resonating?
- What should I stop doing?

### Quarterly Strategy Check

- Are my pillars still relevant?
- Is my narrative evolving appropriately?
- Who are my top 10 readers? What do they want?
- What experiments should I try?
- What's working in distribution?
- Am I building relationships or just broadcasting?

### Improvement Areas

Track what you want to get better at:

| Area | Current State | Target State | Next Action |
|------|---------------|--------------|-------------|
| Writing speed | | | |
| Post quality | | | |
| Distribution | | | |

## Profile Narrative

### Bio Variations

**Twitter-length (160 char):**
_[TODO: Write this]_

**One paragraph:**
_[TODO: Write this]_

**Full "About Me":**
_[TODO: Write this - use for About page]_

### The "Francois" Story

**Origin**: Where did you start? What shaped you?
**Journey**: Key milestones, pivots, learnings
**Now**: What you're focused on currently
**Future**: Where you're heading

_[TODO: Write your story arc]_

### Proof Points

What demonstrates your expertise/perspective?
- Projects you've built
- Companies you've worked at

## The Meta-Narrative

### How Posts Connect

Each post should:
1. Stand alone (new readers can understand it)
2. Connect to your pillars (thematic coherence)
3. Reference related posts (build the web)
4. Advance your story (show evolution)

### Building a Body of Work

Think of your blog as:
- **A book in progress** - Posts are chapters
- **A portfolio** - Shows range and depth
- **A searchable brain** - Reference for yourself and others
- **A conversation starter** - Invites collaboration

### Long-term Narrative Arc

Year 1: Establish voice, build foundational posts
Year 2: Go deeper, start campaigns, build audience
Year 3: Become known for your pillars, get invited to things
Year 4+: Your blog becomes a platform for bigger projects
