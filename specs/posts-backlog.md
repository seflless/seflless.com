Need some quick ones to fill out blog.

### (Needs good title)

- Needs good title
  - Output -> Source (or is it output to )
  - UI (any app output) that communicates to agents
    - Be clear that it's anything that is visual for starters (three.js, r3f being low hanging fruit. triplex being a good example)
    - Provides inspectable data for growing set of custom tools/toolbars/cli commands
    - Support click, area, selection, record temporal data (animations) and events over time frame
- Reference

  - react-grab and more robust integrated solution in TanStack (or was it vue?)
  - agentation
  - that toolbar inspired by it by that designer
  - Playgrounds by Anthropic's devrel as a hint of a bigger idea
    - Litt's similar thinking

- Needs some research and potentially a prototype.
- I'd rather this be a call to arms than do too much work.
