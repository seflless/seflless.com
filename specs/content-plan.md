# Content Plan

System for planning, drafting, and publishing blog content.

## Workflow

### 1. Capture
Ideas go into `ideas.md` (unstructured, quick capture)

### 2. Plan
Move promising ideas here with more detail:
- Working title
- Key points to cover
- Target audience
- Estimated effort
- Dependencies (need to build something first?)

### 3. Draft
Create post file in `src/content/blog/` with `draft: true`

### 4. Review
- Self-review
- (Future: AI review with writing style skill)
- (Future: Preview deploy for feedback)

### 5. Publish
Set `draft: false`, merge to main
