# Welcome!

This is my new personal blog built with [Astro](https://astro.build), React, and Tailwind CSS.

## Why This Stack?

I wanted a blog where each post could be its own creative playground. Some posts will be simple text like this one. Others might include:

- Interactive 3D visualizations with Three.js
- Generative art experiments
- Mini games
- Data visualizations

The magic of Astro's **islands architecture** is that each post only loads the JavaScript it needs. A text post like this one ships zero JS to the browser.

## What's Next?

I'll be sharing projects, thoughts, and experiments here. Stay tuned!
