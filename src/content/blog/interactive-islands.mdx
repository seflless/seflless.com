# Interactive Components with Astro Islands

One of the coolest features of Astro is its **islands architecture**. Instead of shipping a JavaScript framework to render the entire page, you can choose exactly which components need interactivity.

## A Simple Counter

Here's a React counter component. It only hydrates when the page loads, leaving the rest of the page as static HTML:

<Counter client:load />

The `client:load` directive tells Astro to hydrate this component on page load. There are other options too:

- `client:idle` - Hydrate when the browser is idle
- `client:visible` - Hydrate when the component enters the viewport
- `client:media` - Hydrate based on a media query

## Why This Matters

This means you can have a blog post that's mostly static text (fast!) but still includes interactive elements where you need them. Each island is independent - it loads its own JavaScript and doesn't affect the rest of the page.

Try clicking the counter above - it's a real React component, but the rest of this page is just HTML.
